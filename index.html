								<h3><em>30.12.2020 &nbsp;</em>vAmiga 0.9.16.2 with ARM support released</h3>
								<p>Today, a new version of vAmiga has been released. The update has been optimized for macOS Big Sur and supports Mac computers with Apple silicon.</p>

								<h3><em>25.11.2020 &nbsp;</em>No ARM support</h3>
								<p>Please note that neither VirtualC64 nor vAmiga work on Macs with ARM CPUs, yet. It will probably take a while until ARM models will be supported, because I currently don't have the appropriate hardware at hand.</p>

								<h3><em>25.11.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga 0.9.15 released</h3>
								<p>Today, a new version of vAmiga has been released. The update comes with several compatibilty improvements and support for 3.5" HD diskettes. Detailed release notes can be found on the GitHub releases page.</p>

								<h3><em>18.11.2020 &nbsp;</em> Third-party game pad support</h3>

								<p>At the moment, both VirtualC64 and vAmiga are still lacking support for some popular game controllers. Since I can only make the necessary code changes for devices in my possession, I have created an <a href="https://www.amazon.de/hz/wishlist/ls/35K6X4B0FIEOF/ref=nav_wishlist_lists_2?_encoding=UTF8&type=wishlist">Amazon wishlist</a>  containing a number of yet incompatible devices. If you want to have another controller supported, please let me know the exact model name. I will then add it to the wishlist, and with a bit of luck, a noble donor will be found who will order the device.
								</p>

								<h3><em>11.10.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga 0.9.13 released</h3>

								<p>This release of vAmiga adds the ability of recording videos (FFmpeg is required to be installed on your machine). Furthermore, it fixes two important issues that had been introduced recently. In v0.9.10.1, a sprite sequencer bug found its way into the emulator that caused graphics glitches in many demos. Furthermore, the emulator does no longer crash when a snapshot is loaded.
								</p>

								<h3><em>29.9.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga 0.9.12 released</h3>

								<p>vAmiga continues to stabilize. The latest version which has been released today contains several compatibility improvements and adds the ability to encode and decode DOS disks.
								</p>

								<h3><em>2.7.2020 &nbsp;</em> VirtualC64 3.4 released</h3>

								<p>This version will probably be the last in the 3.x series. For the upcoming 
									version 4.0 I plan to backport large parts of code from vAmiga. This will 
									lead to major changes that will not only affect the internal code base but 
									also the user interface.
								</p>

								<h3><em>1.7.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga 0.9.8.4 released</h3>

								<p>The vAmiga project is on track and stabilizing. Compatibility has improved 
									considerably since the release of v0.9. As always, bug reports on GitHub are 
									very welcome. 
								</p>

								<h3><em>22.4.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga 0.9 released</h3>

								<p>I am proud to announce that vAmiga has left the alpha testing phase today. Bug 
									reports on GitHub are highly appreciated.</p>

								<h3><em>5.3.2020 &nbsp;</em> New web site in place</h3>

								<p>The old web page is gone for good. I replaced it by a new template scheme which
									allows me to publish in a more blog-style manner.</p>

								<h3><em>4.3.2020 &nbsp;</em> vAmiga status update</h3>

								<p>vAmiga development is going well. Many pending compatibility issues have been
									solved and development is shifting towards refactoring and cleaning up the
									code base. Once this is done, the emulator is ready for its first v0.9 release.
